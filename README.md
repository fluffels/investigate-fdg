# Force-Directed Graph Rendering Investigation

This project showcases a force-directed graph layout rendered in real-time using Vulkan.
It simulates Twitter follow data (nodes, edges) and applies a physical simulation to position the nodes.

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Only works on Windows! Needs Vulkan SDK and a C++20 compiler.
./build_prod.bat
```
